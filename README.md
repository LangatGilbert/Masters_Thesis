This is a repository of all the R code used in my master's thesis project submitted to University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. The full title is  as follows:

Spatio-Temporal Dynamics in Adaptive Multispecies Competitive communities
---
Key files:
..*```Eigenvalues_distn.R ``` -> Fuctions for eigenvalues distribution visualization.
..*```MetaCommunity_Fuctions.R``` -> Functions for implementing the metacommunity adaptive model. Three functions have been written for **Elimination-Dispersal switching**, **Optimization-Dispersal switching** and **Non-switching-Dispersal**. 
..*``` MetaCommunity_Simulation.R``` -> Implements the metacommunity fuctions developed in ```MetaCommunity_Fuctions.R```
..*```Single_Community_Functions.R``` -> Contains fuctions written for switching implementation in a single community. The two switching forms plus stability fuctions written
..*```Single_Community_Simulation.R``` -> Simulations for single community are done by calling ```Single_Community_Functions.R```. Single community dynamics visualization is done.

The current research study was done using R version 3.3.3 (2017-03-06)--"Anothe Canoe".  The R codes included in this project have not been tasted for in previous or new R versions.
